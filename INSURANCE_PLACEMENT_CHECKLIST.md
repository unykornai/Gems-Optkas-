    ───────────────                         ───────────
    "Is it insured?"                        "Specie policy being bound — binder
                                             available within 5–7 BD of vault selection."

    "Who is the loss payee?"                "You are — lender named as first loss payee
                                             and additional insured."

    "What perils are covered?"              "All-risk including theft, fire, flood,
                                             earthquake, transit, mysterious disappearance."

    "What's the deductible?"                "Per broker quote — we're targeting lowest
                                             available. Typical: $25K–$50K for this class."

                                             vault-to-inspection movement."

    "What about the vault itself?"          "Vault provider carries their own insurance.
                                             Our specie policy sits on top of that."

    "Do you have crime coverage?"           "Yes — fidelity bond covering employee
