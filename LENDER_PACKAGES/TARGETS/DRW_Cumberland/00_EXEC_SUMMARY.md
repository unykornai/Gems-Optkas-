## WHY DRW / CUMBERLAND

Cumberland (DRW's digital asset subsidiary) is a principal trading and lending firm with deep stablecoin liquidity. This deal is a clean fit:

- **$42M physical asset backing $2M loan** = 21:1 coverage
- **4.76% LTV** = near-zero credit risk — far below your typical lending parameters
- **60-day bullet** = short duration, clean P&L
- **Vault escrow with lender-only default release** = you control the collateral
- **Senior secured, overcollateralized** — real-world asset, zero digital-market correlation
- **Full counsel-grade document pack ready** = close this week

This is NOT gem financing. This is an **overcollateralized senior secured bridge** that happens to use a physical asset with independent appraisal and third-party custody.
