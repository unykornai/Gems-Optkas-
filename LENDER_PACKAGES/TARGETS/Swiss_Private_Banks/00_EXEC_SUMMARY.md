## WHY LOMBARD CREDIT

Swiss private banks have a long history of Lombard lending against precious materials. This deal offers:

- **Conservative LTV** — 30% would be $12.6M, representing 333% overcollateralization
- **Institutional borrower** — OPTKAS1 LLC is a Wyoming Series LLC with diversified $936.6M asset base
- **Independent appraisal** — GIA-credentialed gemologist with 40+ years, DocuSign authenticated
- **Swiss custody available** — Malca-Amit Geneva or Brink's Zurich, lender's election
- **CURRENT ASSET designation** — appraiser explicitly states financial market suitability

This is not a one-off gem loan. OPTKAS1 is an institutional borrower with professional documentation, technology infrastructure, and multiple asset classes.
