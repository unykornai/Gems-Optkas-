**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 9, 2026

## TIER 1 LPs — Phase 3

**Firms:** Jump Crypto · Virtu Financial · Flow Traders

### Opening (30 seconds — use verbatim)

> "This is not a lending conversation and not a capital raise.
> We're building an XRPL + Stellar settlement platform for regulated RWAs and stablecoin flows.
> We're not asking for a mandate today — we're sanity-checking market structure and future liquidity design."

### What You ARE Pitching

- Institutional RWA/stablecoin flow expected post-Phase 2
- Controlled issuance cadence
- No retail chaos
- No price support requests
- Long-horizon liquidity needs

### Key Framing Line (use verbatim)

> **"We treat liquidity as infrastructure, not optics."**

### What You Ask Them

- What *volume + behavior* thresholds they require before engagement
- Preferred mandate structures (retainer vs performance vs hybrid)
- Venue preferences (on-ledger AMM vs off-ledger flow)

### What You Explicitly Say

> "We will not launch public AMMs until flow is predictable."

### What You Do NOT Say

| ❌ BANNED PHRASE | WHY |
|:-----------------|:----|
| "support the price" | Implies price defense mandate — not what LPs do |
| "defend the token" | Same — conflates LP with market manipulation |
| "guaranteed volume" | No LP will believe this; kills credibility instantly |
| "yield" | Crosses into lending/DeFi territory |
| "ICO" | Nuclear reputation word in institutional context |

### Desired Outcome

**A future checkpoint, not a commitment.**  
You want them to say: *"Come back when you have X months of flow data."*  
That's a win — it means they're interested but disciplined. Match their energy.

---

## TIER 2 LPs — Phase 2

**Firms:** Keyrock · B2C Group · Amber Group (LP side)

### Opening (30 seconds — use verbatim)

> "We're approaching you specifically as a *liquidity operator*, not as a lender.
> This is about spreads, inventory, and controlled market formation — not balance-sheet risk."

### What You ARE Pitching

- Structured issuance support
- Stablecoin-heavy pairs
- Predictable flow windows
- Fee-based engagement

### Key Framing Line (use verbatim)

> **"We want boring liquidity that scales, not volatility that attracts attention."**

### What You Ask Them

- Minimum viable volume for engagement
- Preferred pair sequencing
- Kill-switch / pause expectations

### What You Explicitly Say

> "There is no retail incentive program and no liquidity mining."

### What You Do NOT Say

| ❌ BANNED PHRASE | WHY |
|:-----------------|:----|
| "TVL targets" | DeFi metric — signals retail mindset |
| "community trading" | Implies uncontrolled retail flow |
| "marketing campaigns" | LPs don't care about marketing; signals amateur |
| "pump protection" | Conflates LP with market manipulation |

### Desired Outcome

**Phase-2 soft alignment + draft mandate shapes.**  
You want them to say: *"Send us the pair list and expected flow windows."*  
That means they're thinking operationally. Good sign.

## TIER 3 / DUAL-ROLE FIRMS — Phase 1

**Firms:** Wintermute · GSR · Cumberland (DRW) · FalconX (LP side)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** These firms also appear in your lending pipeline (Route 2.5).
> This call is **strictly the microstructure side**. Do NOT mix conversations.
> See [LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER_STRATEGY.md § Conversation Separation Protocol](LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER_STRATEGY.md) for the firewall rules.

### Opening (30 seconds — use verbatim)

> "You're on this call because you understand both credit plumbing and market microstructure.
> Today's discussion is strictly the *microstructure side*."

### What You ARE Pitching

- Emergency / early liquidity scenarios
- Thin, controlled books
- Short-duration exposure
- Tight spreads, low inventory risk

### Key Framing Line (use verbatim)

> **"This is operational liquidity, not speculative liquidity."**

### What You Ask Them

- How they separate lending vs LP internally
- What data they need before turning on size
- What *they* consider a clean early market

### What You Explicitly Say

> "We are comfortable with low volume if it means orderly behavior."

### What You Do NOT Say

| ❌ BANNED PHRASE | WHY |
|:-----------------|:----|
| "we need depth immediately" | Signals desperation — LPs will exploit this |
| "we want aggressive discovery" | Implies you want volatile price action |
| "we'll open AMMs everywhere" | Signals no venue discipline |

### Desired Outcome

**Near-term tactical support + behavioral data.**  
You want them to say: *"We can do thin books with tight spreads on [venue]."*  
That's exactly right for Phase 1 — controlled, observable, data-generating.

## UNIVERSAL DO / DO NOT RULES

These apply to **every LP call**, regardless of tier, phase, or relationship.

### ✅ ALWAYS SAY (on every call)

| # | Line | Purpose |
|:--|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | "This is not a lending pitch." | Category separation — say it in the first 30 seconds |
| 2 | "We don't ask for price support." | Removes the #1 red flag for institutional MMs |
| 3 | "Liquidity follows behavior, not announcements." | Signals patience and discipline |
| 4 | "We control issuance tightly." | Reassures LPs that supply won't flood unexpectedly |

### ❌ NEVER SAY (on any LP call, ever)

| # | Banned Word/Phrase | Why It's Banned |
|:--|:-------------------|:----------------|
| 1 | **ICO** | Nuclear reputation word. Instant credibility loss. |
| 2 | **Yield** | Crosses into lending/DeFi. LPs don't think in yield. |
| 3 | **APY** | Same as yield — DeFi framing, not MM framing. |
| 4 | **Community incentives** | Signals retail-first approach. LPs will disengage. |
| 5 | **Liquidity mining** | DeFi mechanism. Institutional MMs don't mine. |
| 6 | **Floor price** | Implies price defense. LPs provide depth, not floors. |
| 7 | **Price stability** | Use **"orderly markets"** instead. Subtle but critical. |

### The Test

> If you say any of the banned phrases on an LP call, you've crossed categories.
> LPs will hear "this team doesn't understand what we do" — and they'll be right.

### The sequence matters:

1. ✅ **Phase 24B** — Built the LP strategy layer (roles, tiers, phasing)
2. ✅ **Lever 1** — Scripted the first 90 seconds (this document)
3. 🔜 **Lever 2** — Liquidity KPIs to capture before Phase 2 engagement
4. 🔜 **Lever 3** — AMM guardrails (which pairs must never launch early)
