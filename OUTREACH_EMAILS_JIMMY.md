## EMAIL 2 — Crypto Stablecoin Bridge (Route 2.5)

**SEND TO:** Galaxy Digital, FalconX, Maple Finance, BlockTower, Stone Ridge, Brevan Howard Digital, DAMREV  
**SUBJECT LINE:** Overcollateralized Stablecoin Bridge — $42M Appraised Gemstone Backing

---

```
Subject: Overcollateralized Stablecoin Bridge — $42M Appraised Gemstone Backing

Dear [CONTACT NAME / OTC Desk / Credit Team],

OPTKAS1 LLC is seeking a short-term stablecoin bridge facility (USDC or USDT)
backed by independently appraised, physical gemstone collateral.

THE ASK:
— Facility: $2,000,000 (USDC or USDT)
— Collateral: 2kg rough Chrysoberyl-Alexandrite, appraised at $42,000,000
— LTV: 4.76% — this is 21:1 overcollateralization
— Term: 60 days (bullet)
— Return: 4% flat (annualized equivalent: ~24%)
— Settlement: On-chain (USDC/USDT) or wire

WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT:
— This is NOT a crypto-collateral loan. The collateral is a PHYSICAL gemstone.
— The collateral does NOT correlate to crypto markets.
— At 4.76% LTV, there is no realistic liquidation scenario.
— The appraiser explicitly designated this asset "FOR THE FINANCIAL MARKET."

COLLATERAL DETAILS:
— Asset: Rough Chrysoberyl-Alexandrite (2kg / 10,000ct)
— Appraised value: $42,000,000
— Appraiser: Prof. Norman Rodi, G.G., GIA #7535333
— Report: IDH11022025-5432-2KG, Seal D00289944
— DocuSign: Envelope 98840EC3-C71B-4647-B2FD-0DD80EC4C7F1

SECURITY STRUCTURE:
— Custody: Lender-approved vault (Brink's / Malca-Amit available)
— Insurance: $25.75M blanket via C.J. Coleman (Lloyd's, FCA-regulated)
— Transfer Agent: Securities Transfer Corporation, Plano TX
— Legal: Wyoming Series LLC, counsel-grade documentation available
— Default: Lender controls vault. Lender-only release on default.

BROADER ENTITY PROFILE:
— $5,000,000,000 TC Advantage 5% Secured MTN (STC custody, UCC-1 filed)
— $430,000,000 gemstone portfolio (Alexandrite + rubies)
— $6,600,000 real estate
— Total: $5,436,600,000

We are targeting a 7-day close. All documentation is ready for review.

Regards,

Jimmy

## EMAIL 5 — LP Intro (Dual-Role / Phase 1)

**SEND TO:** Wintermute (LP side), GSR (LP side), DRW/Cumberland (LP side), FalconX (LP side)  
**SUBJECT LINE:** Liquidity Infrastructure Discussion — RWA Settlement Platform

> ⚠️ **JIMMY — READ THIS:** This email is about LIQUIDITY OPERATIONS, not lending.
> Do NOT mention LTV, overcollateralization, or default. See LP_INTRO_CALL_SCRIPTS.md.

```
Subject: Liquidity Infrastructure Discussion — RWA Settlement Platform

Dear [LP DESK / Market Making Team],

I'm reaching out regarding a liquidity infrastructure discussion — this is
NOT a lending inquiry or capital raise.

OPTKAS1 LLC is building a regulated RWA settlement platform on XRPL + Stellar
rails, backed by $5.44B in physical collateral across 5 asset classes.

We are approaching you specifically for your market-making expertise:
— Controlled stablecoin liquidity (USDC/USDT)
— Institutional settlement rails
— Orderly market formation (not price support)

This is an early-phase conversation. We are not requesting a mandate today.
We want to:
1. Share our platform architecture and issuance timeline
2. Understand your engagement thresholds (volume, behavior data)
3. Discuss preferred mandate structures for future phases

KEY CONTEXT:
— We treat liquidity as infrastructure, not optics
— There is no retail incentive program or liquidity mining
— Issuance is tightly controlled
— We will not launch public AMMs until flow is predictable

We're targeting a 20-minute introductory call at your convenience.

Regards,

Jimmy
Manager, OPTKAS1 LLC
jimmy@optkas.com

## EMAIL 6 — LP Intro (Tier 2 / Phase 2)

**SEND TO:** Keyrock, B2C Group, Amber Group (LP side)  
**SUBJECT LINE:** Structured Liquidity Mandate — RWA-Backed Stablecoin Rails

> ⚠️ **JIMMY — READ THIS:** This is a LIQUIDITY email. Do NOT mention collateral,
> LTV, or lending terms. See LP_INTRO_CALL_SCRIPTS.md for call preparation.

```
Subject: Structured Liquidity Mandate — RWA-Backed Stablecoin Rails

Dear [Market Making / Liquidity Team],

OPTKAS1 LLC is exploring structured liquidity mandates for a regulated
RWA settlement platform and is approaching your firm specifically as a
liquidity operator.

This discussion is about spreads, inventory, and controlled market
formation — not balance-sheet risk or lending.

WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:
— XRPL + Stellar settlement infrastructure
— RWA-backed stablecoin flows (USDC/USDT primary)
— Controlled issuance cadence — no retail chaos

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:
— Stablecoin pair market depth
— Structured MM mandate (fee-based: retainer and/or performance)
— 3–6 month initial engagement
— Kill-switch / pause provisions

KEY CONTEXT:
— No liquidity mining, no token incentives
— We want boring liquidity that scales, not volatility
— Institutional counterparties only
— Platform backed by $5.44B collateral (physical assets)

We'd like to schedule a brief introductory call to discuss your minimum
engagement thresholds and preferred pair sequencing.

Regards,

Jimmy
Manager, OPTKAS1 LLC
